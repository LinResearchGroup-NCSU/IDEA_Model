1. Sequence alignment based on MAFFT/Clustal ... (shouldn't change too much of the results)
2. Modeller build in the new CDR loops
3. Recalculate the contact map
4. evaluate the binding energy (affinity)
5. Take 3PQY as an example      

A bigger underlying assumption is with the same pMHC, the TCR should have relatively conserved contact interface
